# About Alice References

Alice References is a place for contributors to get to know the world of the game a bit more. It's based on Tim Burton's version of an older Alice visiting wonderland as a young adult/older teen rather than the classic Lewis Carroll's Alice as a child.

# 2.0 Tim Burton's Alice and Underland

Tim Burton's 2010 movie version of Alice in Wonderland has Alice running away from her surpise engagment party and following the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole into Underland. She visited Underland as a child (like in the orginal Lewis Carroll books), but remembered it in her dreams as 'Wonderland'.

At one point in the movie Alice steals the Red Queen's Bandersnatch. This was my inspiration for my 2020 python version of this project.

## 2.1 Underland

The geography of Underland is described well in [this fandom page](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Underland)

# 3.0 Maps

Maps will help with planning game progression. While the first version of the game will just have a set distance the player needs to travel to reach the White Queen's palace from the Red Queen's palace, later versions will have options for players to take different routes though Underland
