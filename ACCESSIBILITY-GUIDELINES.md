### Heading Levels

Here are some guidlines for heading levels on a page:

1.  There should only be one level one heading per page-designated <h1></h1>. Whatever is inside of this tag is the main title or topic of the page.
2.  From there, the heading levels go from 2 to 6, with each tag level achieving a smaller, as is, font-size.
3.  Level 2 headings should be used for sub-heading titles.
4.  Level 3 headings should be used for sub-topics within a topic designated by a sub-heading.
5.  Level 4 headings could be used to designate a topic maybe in a table of contents or list, with a small amount of information or no information after it.
6.  Level 5 headings could be used for captions under photos.
7.  Level 6 headings could be used for footnotes.

To style heading levels or heading tags, use CSS for things such as color, font-weight, letter spacing, etc.
