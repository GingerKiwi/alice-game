    <h1>The Alice in WonderLand Project</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to Wonderland!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Wonderland! The Alice in Wonderland Project is a html/css/vanilla javascript 
        text-based game with an Alice in Wonderland theme.
    </p>
    <p>This game was orignally created as a python console game as part of a computer science
         course at Massey University, New Zealand in 2020. Part of the assignment was documenting
          the thought process using comments. (So there's a lot of comments in the .py file!). The 
          assignment was the classic Camel game from "Program Arcade Games and With Python And Pygame"
           and orginally concevied in 1979 in "More BASIC Computer Games".
    </p>

        However, the premise of the game is both racist and colonlialist - stealing an camel from the
         "natives" and racing away from them across the Mobi desert. So I changed the theme to Alice from
          Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland movie rescuing the Red Queen's Bandersnatch from his imprissionment
           and racing across Underland to get to the White Queen's castle. I also added a random chance that the
            player would be attacked by the Jabberwocky, be killed, and the Jabberwocky poem would print on the screen.
